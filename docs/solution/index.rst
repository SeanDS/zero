Solutions
=========

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from zero.solution import Solution

The :class:`.Solution` class provides a mechanism for storing, displaying and saving the output of
an :ref:`analysis <analyses/index:Analyses>`; these are usually :ref:`responses
<data/index:Responses>` and :ref:`noise spectral densities <data/index:Noise spectral densities>`.

Retrieving functions
--------------------

Solutions contain methods to retrieve functions contained within those solutions using a variety of
filters. The methods :meth:`.filter_responses`, :meth:`.filter_noise` and :meth:`.filter_noise_sums`
provide ways to match functions against their sources, sinks, :ref:`groups <solution/index:Groups>`
and :ref:`labels <data/index:Labels>`. These methods return a :class:`dict` containing the matched
functions in lists keyed by their group names (see :ref:`Groups <solution/index:Groups>`).

To retrieve an individual function directly, three convenience methods are available:
:meth:`.get_response`, :meth:`~.Solution.get_noise` and :meth:`~.Solution.get_noise_sum`. These take
as arguments the source, sink, group and/or label of the :class:`~.data.Response`,
:class:`~.data.NoiseDensity` or :class:`~.data.MultiNoiseDensity` to retrieve. The source and sink
in :meth:`.get_response` and the sink in :meth:`~.Solution.get_noise` and
:meth:`~.Solution.get_noise_sum` can be :class:`components <.Component>` or :class:`nodes <.Node>`
or names, while the source in :meth:`~.Solution.get_noise` can be a :class:`~.components.Noise` or
:ref:`noise specifier <solution/index:Specifying noise sources and sinks>` such as ``V(op1)``.
Sources cannot be searched against when using :meth:`~.Solution.get_noise_sum`. You can use these
convenience methods to retrieve functions when you know enough information about it to match it
amongst the solution's functions. If multiple functions are found as a result of the filters you
provide, a :class:`ValueError` is thrown.

The table below lists the available filters for the ``filter_`` methods for each function type.
With the exception of the multi-valued filters, i.e. ``sources``, ``sinks``, ``groups`` and
``labels``, these parameters are also available when using the ``get_`` methods.

Specifying response sources and sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`~.data.Response` sources and sinks (and :class:`~.components.Noise` sinks) specified in
:meth:`~.Solution.get_noise` are always components or nodes. You can specify these using either the
corresponding :class:`.Component` or :class:`.Node` objects or by specifying their name as a string.

Assuming that a circuit is built in the following way...

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from zero import Circuit
   >>> from zero.analysis import AcSignalAnalysis
   >>> circuit = Circuit()
   >>> circuit.add_opamp(name="op1", model="OP27", node1="gnd", node2="nin", node3="nout")
   >>> circuit.add_resistor(name="r1", value="1k", node1="nin", node2="nout")
   >>> signal_analysis = AcSignalAnalysis(circuit)
   >>> solution = signal_analysis.calculate(frequencies=np.logspace(0, 4, 1001), input_type="voltage", node="nin")

...responses between the input node and various nodes and components can be retrieved in the
following ways:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> nin = circuit["nin"] # get the input node object
   >>> nout = circuit["nout"] # get the output node object
   >>> print(solution.get_response(nin, nout)) # response between input and output nodes
   nin to nout (V/V)
   >>> print(solution.get_response("nin", "nout")) # alternative string specifier
   nin to nout (V/V)
   >>> print(solution.get_response("nin", "r1")) # response between input node and resistor current (note the units)
   n1 to r1 (A/V)
   >>> print(solution.get_response(label="nin to r1 (A/V)")) # label specifier
   n1 to r1 (A/V)

Specifying noise sources and sinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to retrieve a noise function from a solution, you must specify the noise source in
:meth:`~.Solution.get_noise`. Noise sources can either be specified using their :class:`noise object
<.components.Noise>` or by building a noise specifier string. Noise sinks are specified in the same
way as response sinks (:ref:`see above <solution/index:Specifying response sources and sinks>`).

Specifying the noise source by its object involves first retrieving the component that produces the
noise. Each component holds its noise sources in its properties. For example, op-amps have voltage noise at their output and current noise at their
inverting and non-inverting inputs. Assuming the op-amp is referenced by ``op1``, these can be
retrieved using ``op1.voltage_noise``, ``op1.inv_current_noise`` and ``op1.non_inv_current_noise``,
respectively.

An alternative approach is to use a noise specifier string. These are strings constructed in the
form ``prefix(component-name[, node-name])``, with the prefix representing the type of noise as
shown in this table:

============================  ======  ==============
Noise type                    Prefix  Example
============================  ======  ==============
Resistor (Johnson)            ``R``   ``R(r1)``
Op-amp voltage                ``V``   ``V(op1)``
Op-amp non-inverting current  ``I``   ``I(op1, np)``
Op-amp inverting current      ``I``   ``I(op1, nm)``
============================  ======  ==============

Assuming that a circuit is built in the following way...

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from zero import Circuit
   >>> from zero.analysis import AcNoiseAnalysis
   >>> circuit = Circuit()
   >>> circuit.add_opamp(name="op1", model="OP27", node1="gnd", node2="nin", node3="nout")
   >>> circuit.add_resistor(name="r1", value="1k", node1="nin", node2="nout")
   >>> noise_analysis = AcNoiseAnalysis(circuit)
   >>> solution = noise_analysis.calculate(frequencies=np.logspace(0, 4, 1001), input_type="voltage", node="nin", sink="nout")

...noise functions can be retrieved with e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> op1 = circuit["op1"] # get the op1 object
   >>> print(solution.get_noise(op1.voltage_noise, "nout")) # voltage noise at op1
   V(op1) to nout
   >>> print(solution.get_noise("V(op1)", "nout")) # alternative string specifier
   V(op1) to nout
   >>> print(solution.get_noise(op1.inv_current_noise, "nout")) # current noise at op1's inverting input
   I(op1, nin) to nout
   >>> print(solution.get_noise("I(op1, nin)", "nout")) # alternative string specifier
   I(op1, nin) to nout
   >>> print(solution.get_noise(label="I(op1, nin) to nout")) # label specifier
   I(op1, nin) to nout

Groups
------

Solutions support grouping as a means to keep different sets of functions separate, such as those
from different analyses. In most cases, groups do not need to be considered when accessing,
manipulating and plotting a solution's functions, but they become important when solutions are
:ref:`combined <solution/index:Combining solutions>`.

By default, functions are added to a solution's default group. Functions can be added to another
group by passing the ``group`` parameter to one of :meth:`.add_response`,
:meth:`~.Solution.add_noise` or :meth:`.add_noise_sum`. Groups can be renamed with
:meth:`.rename_group` and merged with :meth:`.merge_group`. The functions in the default group can
be moved to a new group with :meth:`.move_default_group_functions`.

Plotting with groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a solution containing multiple groups is plotted, the functions in each group have different
formatting applied. The colours of functions within each group follow roughly the same progression
as the first group, but with gradually lighter shades and different line styles.

To plot functions from different groups without different shades or line styles, you should combine
them into the same group (see above).

Combining solutions
-------------------

Solutions from different analyses can be combined and plotted together. The method
:meth:`~.Solution.combine` takes as an argument another solution or multiple solutions, and returns
a new solution containing the combined functions.

.. warning::

    In order to be combined, the solutions must have identical frequency vectors.

Solutions can be combined in two ways as determined by :meth:`.combine`'s ``merge_groups`` flag.
When ``merge_groups`` is ``False`` (the default), the groups in each source solution are copied into
the resulting solution. The default group in each source solution is copied into a group with the
name of the corresponding source solution, and other groups have the corresponding source solution's
name appended in brackets. This form of combination supports the ``sol_a + sol_b`` syntax. When
``merge_groups`` is ``True``, the groups in each source solution are merged in the resulting
solution. This requires that the source solutions contain *no* identical functions in cases where
the group names are the same (including the default group).

The resulting solution's group names can be changed using :meth:`.rename_group`.

.. hint::

    Solutions containing different types of function can be combined, such as solutions with the
    results of :ref:`signal analyses <analyses/ac/signal:Small AC signal analysis>` and solutions
    with the results of :ref:`noise analyses <analyses/ac/noise:Small AC noise analysis>`. In order
    to plot all of the combined solution's functions in such a case, you must call both
    :meth:`.plot_responses` and :meth:`.plot_noise`.

Here is an example of solution combination using a :ref:`LISO model <liso/index:LISO compatibility>`
of an RF summing box with two inputs and one output:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    from zero.liso import LisoInputParser

    # Create parser.
    parser = LisoInputParser()

    base_circuit = """
    l l2 420n nlf nout
    c c4 47p nlf nout
    c c1 1n nrf gnd
    r r1 1k nrf gnd
    l l1 600n nrf n_l1_c2
    c c2 330p n_l1_c2 n_c2_c3
    c c3 33p n_c2_c3 nout
    c load 20p nout gnd

    freq log 100k 100M 1000
    uoutput nout
    """

    # Parse the base circuit.
    parser.parse(base_circuit)
    # Set the circuit input to the low frequency port.
    parser.parse("uinput nlf 50")
    # Ground the unused input.
    parser.parse("r nrfsrc 5 nrf gnd")
    # Calculate the solution.
    solutionlf = parser.solution()
    solutionlf.name = "LF Circuit"

    # Reset the parser's state.
    parser.reset()

    # Parse the base circuit.
    parser.parse(base_circuit)
    # Set the input to the radio frequency port.
    parser.parse("uinput nrf 50")
    # Ground the unused input.
    parser.parse("r nlfsrc 5 nlf gnd")
    # Calculate the solution.
    solutionrf = parser.solution()
    solutionrf.name = "RF Circuit"

    # Combine the solutions. By default, this keeps the functions from each source solution in
    # different groups in the resulting solution. This makes the plot show the functions with
    # different styles and shows the source solution's name as a suffix on each legend label.
    solution = solutionlf.combine(solutionrf)

    # Plot.
    solution.plot()
    solution.show()

.. hint::

    The above example makes a call to :meth:`~.Solution.plot`. This relies on :ref:`default
    functions <solution/index:Default functions>` having been set, in this case by the :ref:`LISO
    compatibility module <liso/index:LISO compatibility>`, which is normally not the case when a
    circuit is constructed and simulated natively. In such cases, calls to :meth:`.plot_responses`
    and :meth:`.plot_noise` with filter parameters are usually required.

Default functions
-----------------

Default functions are functions that are plotted when a call is made to :meth:`.plot_responses` or
:meth:`.plot_noise` without any filters. Functions are not normally marked as default when an
:ref:`analysis <analyses/index:Analyses>` builds a solution.

A function can be made default by setting the ``default`` flag to ``True`` when calling
:meth:`~.Solution.add_response`, :meth:`~.Solution.add_noise` or :meth:`~.Solution.add_noise_sum`.

.. note::

    When a :ref:`LISO script <liso/index:LISO compatibility>` is simulated by |Zero|, the functions
    plotted by the LISO script are marked as defaults. This behaviour assists when :ref:`comparing a
    LISO solution to that of Zero <cli/liso:Comparing a native simulation to LISO>`, since LISO
    does not output every possible response or noise whereas |Zero| does. In this case, only the
    functions that are requested in the LISO script are set as defaults in the |Zero| solution, so
    that only the relevant functions are compared.

Accessing the raw data
----------------------

Solutions are a high level wrapper around :ref:`functions <data/index:Functions>` which themselves
contain :ref:`series <data/index:Series>`. The raw data can be accessed from a solution by first
grabbing the respective function and grabbing the `x` or `y` data from the series:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> my_noise = solution.get_noise(op1.voltage_noise, "nout")
    >>> print(my_noise.series.x)
    array([1.00000000e+00, 1.00925289e+00, 1.01859139e+00, ...,
           9.81747943e+03, 9.90831945e+03, 1.00000000e+04])
    >>> print(my_noise.series.y)
    array([1.29259971e-07, 1.28826858e-07, 1.28396274e-07, ...,
           6.71859930e-08, 6.71854939e-08, 6.71849878e-08])

These are Numpy arrays so you can perform any usual Numpy operation on them. For example, if you
wished to find the y-axis value corresponding to the x-axis value nearest some reference value (this
is often useful when using log-spaced axes), you could do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x, y = my_noise.series.x, my_noise.series.y
    >>> xref = 9.4  # The x-axis value to get the closest y-axis value to.
    >>> index = np.abs(x - xref).argmin()
    >>> print(x[index], y[index])  # The actual x-axis value and its corresponding y-value.
    9.375620069258803 7.6263707283595e-08
